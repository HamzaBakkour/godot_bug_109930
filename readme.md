## 1. Introduction: What is Godot?

**Godot** is a **free and open-source game engine** designed for creating both **2D and 3D games**. It provides a complete set of tools for game design, animation, scripting, and deployment—all within a single integrated environment.

Developed under the **MIT License**, Godot allows developers to use, modify, and distribute their games without any licensing fees or royalties. The engine is maintained by the **Godot Engine community** and the **Godot Foundation**, supported by contributors from around the world.

Godot’s structure is based on a **scene and node system**. Each game object—such as a character, camera, or light—is represented as a node, and groups of nodes form a scene. This hierarchical approach encourages **modularity**, **reusability**, and **clean project organization**.

The engine supports several programming languages:
- **GDScript** – a lightweight, Python-like language made specifically for Godot.  
- **C#** – for developers who prefer .NET integration.  
- **C++** – for performance-critical extensions.  
- **Visual Script** – a node-based scripting alternative for non-programmers.  

Godot also features an **integrated development environment (IDE)** with tools for physics, animation, user interface design, shader creation, and debugging. Games developed in Godot can be exported to multiple platforms, including **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web (HTML5)**.

## 2. Background

This report documents the investigation and resolution of a bug found in the `Curve2D::get_closest_point()` function of the Godot Engine. The issue, discussed in [GitHub Issue #109930](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/109930), caused incorrect nearest-point calculations for certain curve configurations.

The `Curve2D` class is widely used in 2D game development for path following, navigation, and animation systems. An error in this function can lead to inaccurate object positioning and movement behaviors.

## 3. Problem Description

The function `get_closest_point()` is designed to return the point on a curve closest to a given position in 2D space. However, under certain conditions—such as small or degenerate curve segments—the algorithm produced inaccurate results.

Below is a simplified version of the affected section of code:

```cpp
Vector2 Curve2D::get_closest_point(const Vector2 &p_to_point) const {
    for (int i = 0; i < pc - 1; i++) {
        Vector2 origin = r[i];
        Vector2 direction = (r[i + 1] - origin) / interval;
        // Distance comparison logic here occasionally failed for short segments.
    }
}
